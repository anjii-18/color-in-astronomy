# color-in-astronomy
Here, I created color diagrams using python and used these diagrams to distinguish between different types of objects such as temperature of stars from their B-V. Also, I analyzed deeply about Blackbody Energy Distribution Curve, Wein's Displacement Law and its application, and hence calculation of average temperature of sun and polar star.
